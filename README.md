## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
Ethiopia’s economic instability is worsened by widespread informal work, lack of verified income proof, and limited access to financial services for youth and informal workers. This exclusion results in unemployment, poverty, and stunted economic growth.

### Planned Solution
FaydaWorks is a platform that leverages Ethiopia’s Fayda digital ID to create a verified ecosystem where youth can log informal gigs, build trusted digital work portfolios, and transition into startup founders. Using the Fayda FIN, users gain access to microloans, skill badges, and startup resources, enabling economic inclusion and empowerment.

### Expected Outcome
- Empower millions of informal workers to prove their income and skills.
- Facilitate youth entrepreneurship through verified startup registration.
- Reduce unemployment and economic instability by linking verified labor to financial services and government aid.
- Provide policymakers and NGOs with real-time data on youth economic activities.

### Fayda's Role
Fayda digital ID (FIN) is central to our solution, providing a secure, verifiable identity for users to authenticate, log their work, and build trusted economic profiles. Fayda enables fraud prevention, financial inclusion, and trust between workers, employers, and lenders.
